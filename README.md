## 👋 Hi, I'm Jingle

I'm a full-stack engineer on adobe.com, passionate about delivering performant, reliable, and user-friendly experiences.

🏢 Most of my public contributions reflect production-level work built under adobe.com’s conventions, which emphasize staying close to the web platform—favoring **vanilla JavaScript, minimal abstraction, and reduced use of build process** to optimize for speed, stability, and maintainability.

🧪 Outside of these, I also enjoy using tools like TypeScript, Vite, React, D3, P5, Tailwind, etc. My favorite web framework is **Astro** ✨.

🔧 Before my current role, I had a lot of fun working on automation, developer tools, CI/CD pipelines, and also diving into backend work—handling APIs, databases, and data flows from source to service.
